We looked for a sources of a smart elevator and a algorithm of an smart elevator, 
we found a few articals on the subjec that helped us understand the projrct. 
Here are the articals that we were halpped:

For this project we used an offline algorithm.
Offline algorithm gets all the problem data from the beginning and required to produce an answer that solve the giving problem(the explanation from Wikipedia).
In simple words in offline algorithm all the inputs is available to us in advance, 
and according to that we can write an algorithm that fits for all the inputs,
meaning, because we gets all the input in advance we can write an algorithm more affective.


Our algorithm runs on all the elevators in the building and sorts the elevators according to their speed.
In each received call the algorithm checks the number of floors to be passed according to the given call
and sends the elevator accordingly according to the speed required for this call.
For example, an elevator that will have to go through a large number of floors will be the fastest elevator in the system,
if it is occupied the reading will move to the fastest elevator that follows.
